# Terms And Conditions

Set of terms a host or a user accepts before creating or joining a trip.

## Host Terms And Conditions

A trip host must accept the currently active host terms and conditions before creating a trip.

## User Terms And Conditions

A user must accept the currently active user terms and conditions before joining a trip.

## How It Works

- When creating a new terms and conditions document, the admin can specify an effective date in the future, at which the terms will be active.
- The current terms will stay active until a new terms document is activated.
- The super admin can edit the active document only.
- The admin can view any previous versions of the terms and conditions.
- Only super admins can create a new terms document.
